If you want to watch VidgoTV video without any problems, whether you're a first-time user or you've been away for a while, you'll need to know how to sign in.  You can easily ditch cable with VidgoTV thanks to their adaptable plans, cross-device connectivity, and contract-free service.

 You must ensure that you have correct account access before beginning streaming.  If you're having problems logging into your VidgoTV account, or if you just have some general queries, this guide has you covered.

 Is VidgoTV A Mystery?
 Among the many channels offered by VidgoTV, a live streaming TV service, are sports networks, entertainment networks, news networks, and channels aimed towards families.  Fans who would rather not commit to a cable subscription plan in the long run but yet want the freedom to watch on multiple devices would like this service.  Stream VidgoTV video from any location in the US as long as you have a valid membership and an internet connection.

 All users need to do to access these services is successfully sign in to their VidgoTV account.

 The VidgoTV Account Login Process
 To start, go to www.vidgo.com on a desktop, laptop, or mobile device, or launch the VidgoTV app on a smart TV.  You can find the "Sign In" option on the site or the app screen.  In most cases, you may find it in the upper right corner of the webpage or immediately upon opening the app.

 Select "Sign In," and then provide the credentials associated with your VidgoTV account (email address and password).  Press the "Login" button after you've verified your information.  You'll be whisked away to the main screen, where you'll find all the channels, your saved shows, and the controls.

 Verify that the login information you provided is correct.  The majority of login problems occur because users have entered the wrong email address or password.

 Failure to Successfully Login?  Take These Steps First
 Get over it if you're having trouble logging into VidgoTV.  When prompted, click the "Forgot Password?" link to access the login page.  Vidgo will email you a link to reset your password after you enter your registered email address.  To reset your password and attempt to log in again, please see the email for instructions.

 The login screen may not load correctly if your internet connection is unstable, so be sure you have a reliable connection.  If you're still having trouble logging in after updating to the latest version, you might want to try uninstalling the app.

 If you're still having trouble accessing the site, try clearing your browser's cache or using a different device.

 Access VidgoTV on Any Device
 Roku, Fire TV Stick, Apple TV, and smart TVs are just a few of the many devices that VidgoTV is compatible with.  For access on these platforms, get the VidgoTV app from the app store on your device.  The app will prompt you for your login information or show you an activation code after you launch it.

 If you see an activation code, copy it and paste it into the designated field on the activation page. Then, use your email and password to access your account.  Doing so will authorize the device and sync your account.

 To keep your information safe and make things easy to use, the VidgoTV sign in procedure across devices follows the same secure protocol.

 Keep Yourself Signed In for Effortless Watching
 If given the option, select "Keep me signed in" for optimal performance.  Instead of repeatedly entering your credentials, this saves them for you.  If you want to make sure your account stays safe when you use this function, use a private device.

 If necessary, logging out is a breeze.  If you want to change who watches or if you're using a shared device, you can alter it in the account settings of your device or browser.

 Reasons to Value Your VidgoTV Account
 Live TV, your favorite shows, bookmarked material, and personal settings are all accessible through your account, which is more than simply a login.  After you've gained full access, you'll be able to do things like manage numerous streams, change plans, update billing information, and establish parental controls.

 To access all of these features and keep control of your viewing experience, you must sign in to your VidgoTV account.
